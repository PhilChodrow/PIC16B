In this blog post, you'll create a simple webapp using Flask and describe the how you did it. The skills you'll need are: 

1. Flask fundamentals, including `render_template()`, the basic anatomy of templates, and  user interactions. 
2. Database skills, including adding items to databases and displaying them. 
3. Basic CSS in order to add a bit of personal flare to your webapp. 

**You are not required to deploy your app** to the internet, although you are certainly welcome to do so if you wish. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Overview </div>

The app you're going to build is a simple message bank. It should do two things: 

1. Allow the user to **submit** messages to the bank. 
2. Allow the user to **view** a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank. 

Additionally, you should use CSS to make your app look attractive and interesting! I encourage you to get creative on this. 

Your Blog Post should contain several screencaps from the functioning of your app, as well as a discussion of the Python methods you implemented to create your app. 

You are free to (and indeed encouraged) to build on any of the [example](https://github.com/PIC16B/flask-examples) [apps](https://github.com/PIC16B/flask-interactions) from class, as well as any other resources you are able to find. 

**The code for your app must be hosted in a GitHub repository.** I suggest you begin by creating such a repository. Commit and push each time you successfully add a new piece of functionality or resolve a bug. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Steps </div>

# §1. Enable Submissions

First, create a `submit` template with three user interface elements: 

1. A text box for submitting a message. 
2. A text box for submitting the name of the user. 
3. A "submit" button. 

Personally, I found it helpful to put navigation links (the top two links at the top of the screen) inside a template called `base.html`. I then had the `submit.html` template `extend` `base.html`. You can find an example of `extend`ing templates in [the code from our lecture](https://github.com/PIC16B/flask-interactions) on interactions and machine learning. 

Here's an example of my submission page: 

<figure class="image" style="width:30%">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}_images/BP3-submit.png" alt="A screencap of the message submission interface, including a text entry box for the message, another text entry box for the name of the submitter, and a submit button">
    <figcaption><i>Example of the message submission interface. Yours should look different!</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, write two Python functions for database management in a new file `app.py` (you can also write them in a separate `.py` file and `import` them into `app.py`). 

- `get_message_db()` should handle creating the database of messages. 
    1. Check whether there is a database called `message_db` in the `g` attribute of the app. If not, then connect to that database, ensuring that the connection is an attribute of `g`. To do this last step, write a line like do `g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite)`
    2. Check whether a table called `messages` exists in `message_db`, and create it if not. For this purpose, the SQL command `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is helpful. Give the table an `id` column (integer), a `handle` column (text), and a `message` column (text). 
    3. Return the connection `g.message_db`. 
-  `insert_message(request)` should handle inserting a user message into the database of messages. 
    1. Extract the `message` and the `handle` from `request`. You'll need to ensure that your `submit.html` template creates these fields from user input by appropriately specifying the `name` of the input elements. For example: `<input type="text" name="message" id="message">` is what I used in my template to ensure that `request.form["message"]` contained the message input by the user. You should then return the message and the handle. 
    2. Using a cursor, insert the message into the `message` database. Remember that you'll need to provide an ID number, the handle, and the message itself. You'll need to write a SQL command to perform the insertion. 
        - **Note**: when working directly with SQL commands, it is necessary to run `db.commit()` after inserting a row into `db` in order to ensure that your row insertion has been saved. 
        - You should ensure that the ID number of each message is unique. One way to do this is by setting the ID number of a message equal to one plus the current number of rows in `message_db`.  
        - Don't forget to close the database connection within the function! 

Finally, write a function to `render_template()` the `submit.html` template. Since this page will both transmit and receive data, you should ensure that it supports both `POST` and `GET` methods, and give it appropriate behavior in each one. In the `GET` case, you can just render the `submit.html` template with no other parameters. In the `POST` case, you should call `insert_message()` (and then render the `submit.html` template). Maybe it would be nice to add a small note thanking the user for their submission? 

# §2. Viewing Random Submissions

Write a function called `random_messages(n)` which will return a collection of `n` random messages from the `message_db`, or fewer if necessary. This [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279706/select-random-row-from-a-sqlite-table) might help. Don't forget to close the database connection within the function! 

Next, write a new template called `view.html` to display the messages extracted from `random_messages()`. Mine looked like this: 
<figure class="image" style="width:30%">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}_images/BP3-view.png" alt="A screencap of the message viewing interface, two messages excited about PIC16B and the handles of their submitters">
    <figcaption><i>Example of the message viewing interface. Yours can look different!</i></figcaption>
</figure>
I took advantage of the fact that Jinja tags support looping (so I looped over the messages), and I also used the fact that Jinja tags support indexing of objects (so if `m` is a tuple of user handle and message `m[0]` contains the handle and `m[1]` contains the message). 

Finally, write a function to render your `view.html` template. This function should first call `random_messages()` to grab some random messages (I chose a cap of 5), and then pass these messages as an argument to `render_template()`. 

# §3. Customize Your App

Write some CSS to customize your app! At minimum, you should 

- Incorporate a non-default font. 
- Use color in some way. 

Feel free to add additional CSS (and modify your templates if necessary) in order to give your app a personal feel. 

My app in the screencaps above doesn't include any color, because I wanted to focus on showing you the required functionality. Your app should be more colorful!! 

# §4. Blog Post

For your blog post, write a tutorial describing how you constructed your webpage. You should include: 

- Separate code blocks and explanations for each of the Python functions you used to build your app (there should be at least 5). 
- A discussion of at least one of the template files you used in your app. You can copy the source code of the template file into your markdown post.  
- Your blog post must include two screencaps: 
    - In the first screencap, you should show an example of a user submitting a message. In the handle field, **please use either your name or the nickname used on your PIC16B blog**. I've demonstrated this in my screencap illustrating the submission interface in Section §1. 
    - In the second screencap, you should show an example of a user viewing submitted messages. Show at least two messages, one of which is the message you submitted in the previous screencap. **This message should show your name or nickname.** I've demonstrated this in my screencap illustrating the viewing interface in Section §2. 

Additionally, please include in your blog post a link to the GitHub repository containing the code for your app.

Please remember that all specifications must be met in order for the blog post to earn credit. 

## Coding Problem

1. Each of the required functions is implemented in a logical way. 
2. Each of the required functions appears to successfully achieve the required task. 
3. The functions that call `render_template` also include the appropriate additional functions. For example, the function that renders the `view.html` template should also call `random_messages()`. 
4. There is a `css` file that changes the font and incorporates color in the interface in some way. These modifications must be visible in the supplied screencaps. 

## Style and Documentation

1. Helpful comments are supplied throughout the code. **Docstrings are not required in this blog post.** 

## Writing

1. The overall post is written in engaging and unambiguous English prose. There is written explanation throughout the post, such that a PIC16A student could learn to perform the demonstrated tasks by reading the post.  
2. Each block of code has a clearly-explained purpose. 
3. The post is organized into clearly delimited sections using markdown headers (\#), making it easier for the reader to navigate.  
4. The post includes the two required screencaps demonstrating the submission and viewing pages of the app. 
5. The post includes a discussion of all Python functions used to create the app. This should include, at minimum, `get_message_db()`, `insert_message()`, `random_messages()`, and the two functions used to render templates. 
6. The post includes a discussion of at least one of the two templates. 
7. The blog post includes a link to the GitHub repository containing the code for the app.
