    "### Takeaways for Today\n",

    "1. Reading large data sets into memory can be surprisingly slow, and in some cases completely impractical. \n",
    "2. Databases offer a convenient way to perform selective *queries* on our data, allowing us to retrieve only the data that we want at any given time. \n",
    "3. The `sqlite3` package enables us to work with databases using Python commands, and the `pandas` package makes it easy to read the results of database queries as data frames. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've worked exclusively with data that could conveniently fit in memory. Generally speaking, data sets of under 20 megabytes or so can be loaded easily on most modern laptops, although subsequent analysis activities may be slow. Larger data sets can be noticeably slow to even load into memory. For example, you may  have noticed that so far, I've been using a small subset of the NOAA-GHCN data corresponding to the decade 2011-2020. There's much  more data, and I have the complete data set in a file (also uploaded on CCLE) in the same directory as these lecture notes on my personal machine. The complete set of data is not too big to fit in memory, but it's large enough that it's noticeably slow to even load into pandas. Let's take a look. "

    "**Databases** provide us with a structured way to move subsets of data from storage into memory. Python has a module called `sqlite3` (already installed) which we can use to create, manipulate, and query databases. There's also a very handy `pandas` interface, enabling us to efficiently create `pandas` data frames containing exactly the data that we want. Let's get started. \n",

    "After importing the `sqlite3` module, the first thing we should do is connect to a database. In case the specified database does not exist, instantiating the connection will also create an empty database with the specified name.  "

    "But wait! Wasn't the whole point of this to avoid reading in an entire data frame? Indeed! Pandas supplies a nice approach to this using the familiar `pd.read_csv()` function. Supplying a value of `chunksize` will cause `read_csv()` to return not a data frame but an *iterator*, each of whose elements is a piece of the data with number of rows equal to `chunksize`. The data is read \"on the fly\" -- i.e. it's not actually read until we start querying the iterator. Here's an example: "

    "3. The `sqlite3` package enables us to work with databases using Python commands, and the `pandas` package makes it easy to read the results of database queries as data frames. "
