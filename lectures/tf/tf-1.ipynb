    "## A Few Notes on Google and Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a Google product. By teaching you TensorFlow, I take a small step toward extending the influence of Google in the field of machine learning and in the STEM community more broadly. By using TensorFlow in and out of this class, you will do the same. It's important that we both go into this with open eyes about some of the ethical questions surrounding Google's recent work in machine learning. I'd like to stress that I am not an expert on ethics in artificial intelligence. There are likely MANY other important ethical concerns about Google's work  (and the work of other giants in tech and artificial intelligence, like Facebook and Amazon) which are not on my radar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Language Models and Dr. Timnit Gebru\n",
    "\n",
    "In December 2020, Google [fired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/timnit-gebru-google-fired/) prominent AI ethicist Dr. Timnit Gebru, an Ethiopian-American woman, over a sequence of events surrounding [one of her papers](https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf). In this paper, Gebru and coauthors raise ethical concerns about language models---like the ones that Google uses for predictive text applications. These concerns include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The role of these models in homogenizing online culture. \n",
    "- The environmental cost of training these (in some cases, comparable to the carbon footprint of a transatlantic flight). \n",
    "- The frequent instances of language models learning to reproduce biased or hateful text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gebru and her collaborators ultimately recommend a more thoughtful, \"small\", and ethically-informed approach to constructing language models. Naturally, this recommendation would require extensive reorganization of one of Google's major research areas. Possibly because they felt threatened by this and related recommendations, Google managers invented an additional, internal review layer for this paper, even after it had already been accepted at a prominent computer science conference. Dr. Gebru's protest of this made-up red tape was one of the events that led to her firing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gebru's colleague Margaret Mitchell was [also recently fired](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-fires-top-ethical-ai-expert-margaret-mitchell/) in the fall-out from this incident. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Google Translate Is Sexist\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well-documented that machine learning algorithms trained on natural text can inherit biases present in those texts. One of the most direct ways in which we can observe such bias is in Google Translate. Some languages, such as Hungarian, do not possess gendered pronouns. When Google Translate attempts to render these pronouns into a gendered language like English, assumptions are made, as pointed out in [this Tweet by Dora Vargha](https://twitter.com/DoraVargha/status/1373211762108076034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373211762108076034%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-7356743851859968838.ampproject.net%2F2103240330002%2Fframe.html).  Let's demonstrate with the following English sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **he** cooks.\n",
    "> **she** is a political leader.\n",
    "> **she** is an engineer.\n",
    "> **he** is a cleaner.\n",
    "> **he** is beautiful. \n",
    "> **she** is strong. \n",
    "\n",
    "Translate these into Hungarian and back via Google Translate, and here's what you'll get: \n",
    "\n",
    "> **she** cooks.\n",
    "> **he** is a political leader.\n",
    "> **he** is an engineer.\n",
    "> **she** is cleaning.\n",
    "> **she** is beautiful.\n",
    "> **he** is strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that English *has* a gender neutral pronoun (*they*), this would be an easy item to fix, which Google has thus far declined to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Historical Racial and Gender Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Search has a striking history of bias against Black people, especially Black women. This bias was made widely public by UCLA professor Safiya Noble in her book *Algorithms of Oppression*. In one of Dr. Nobel's most famous examples, top results for the phrase \"black girls\" in 2011 consisted of links to porn sites, which did not hold true of searches for \"white girls\" or \"black men.\" As late as 2016, an image search for \"gorillas\" would surface pictures of Black individuals. You can find a brief synopsis of some of Dr. Noble's findings [here](https://time.com/5209144/google-search-engine-algorithm-bias-racism/) (content warning: highly sexually explicit language).  Google has since taken steps to improve these specific examples. "
