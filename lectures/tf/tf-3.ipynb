    "\n",
    "- **Subject matter**: is this news article about news, fashion, finance?\n",
    "- **Emotional valence**: is this tweet happy or sad? Excited or calm? This particular class of questions is so important that it has its own name: *sentiment analysis.* \n",
    "- **Automated content moderation**: is this Facebook comment a possible instance of abuse or harassment? Is this Reddit thread promoting violence? Is this email spam? \n",
    "\n",
    "These are all very different kinds of questions, but many of the same techniques can be used. In these notes, we'll do a simple example of subject matter classification. In future notes, we'll also do some sentiment analysis. \n",

    "At this point, it would be appropriate to be somewhat disturbed -- can it really be correct that the validation accuracy is *higher* than the training accuracy? That doesn't seem right, does it? The reason this occurs is due to those `Dropout` layers in the model. What these layers do is disable (\"drop out\") a fixed percentage of the units in each layer, *but only during training.* This turns out to be a good way to reduce the risk of overfitting. Because the units are used during validation and testing, but not during training, it can happen that indeed the validation and testing scores can be higher. "
