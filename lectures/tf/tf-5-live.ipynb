        "1. First of all, it can take a surprisingly long time to make predictions using our model. This is because we have to call the `predict()` method *for each character*, in order to ensure that the model appropriately takes into account its recent predictions. This can take a pretty long time! \n",
        "2. Second, determining a good value for the temperature can take some experimentation. Note that low temperatures don't necessarily correspond to \"more realistic\" text -- they just correspond to highlighting common patterns in the text, possibly in excess. Higher temperatures also don't necessarily correspond to a \"creative\" algorithm in any normal sense of the word -- set the temperature too high, and you'll just get gibberish. \n",

        "In this case, we were able to create a model for generating Star Trek scripts using an instance of Google Colab in roughly 30 minutes. This model is highly limited. Although it clearly has learned some relevant features of Star Trek scripts, there's no way that you'd mistake the output of the model for an actual script by a screenwriter. Considering how hard this was, imagine how much effort and computational resources are required to create more general language models! Indeed, as highlighted in a [recent and controversial paper](https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf), training large language models in this day and age can require energy expenditure comparable to a trans-Atlantic flight!
