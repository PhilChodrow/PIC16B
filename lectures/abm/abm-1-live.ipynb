    "# Agent-Based Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of lectures, we'll study how to design agent-based models in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An *agent-based model* (ABM) is a simulation model in which many individual entities (*agents*) interact with each other according to fixed rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs are often used for modeling a wide range of social and biological systems. In fact, you've already seen an example of an ABM: the SIR model of disease spred that we studied in the previous lecture is one. There, we relied on tools from NetworkX and various other familiar programming paradigms. We'll now explore the topic of agent-based modeling from a somewhat more systematic and flexible perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a large number of dedicated software packages for agent-based modeling. In this course, we'll use a relatively recent package, called [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html), for agent-based modeling in Python. To install the software, run the following code in your terminal: \n",

    "# The Schelling Model of Racial Segregation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of lecture notes, we will implement the Schelling model of racial residential segregation. The Schelling model is a parable of how only *mild* individual biases can lead to highly segregated outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Schelling Model, individuals of two types begin arranged randomly on a grid, which is often taken to represent a city. Not all grid squares are occupied. Here's an example starting configuration\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the model works: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. At each timestep, agents look at their surroundings. An agent is **unhappy** if fewer than 1/3 of their neighbors have the same type, and is **happy** otherwise. \n",
    "2. All **unhappy** agents pick a random empty spot and move there. All **happy** agents stay where they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "We run the model until all agents are happy. The fundamental result of the model is that, even though agents have only mild biases -- they simply prefer not to be outnumbered --  acting on their preferences can still lead to highly segregated outcomes, like this: \n",

    "### A Note on History\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling model does not include any concepts of historical oppression, wealth, or power, all of which contribute to racial segregation. The message of the Schelling model is that these factors are not **needed** for segregation -- mildly racist individual preferences would be enough. It is important, however, not to confuse this mathematical parable with the actual historical circumstances of racial segregation in the US or elsewhere. In most societies, including the US, racial segregation arises because of systematic oppression enforced by policy, violence, and erasure. \n",

    "Let's start by implementing a bare-bones model. While there is some flexibility in how one does this, there are a few common features of most Mesa models: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There must be an *agent* class, which should inherit from `mesa.Agent`. This class specifies the properties and behaviors of an individual agent in the simulation. \n",
    "    - This class must call  `mesa.Agent.__init__()` as part of its `__init__()` method. \n",
    "    - This class must have a `step()` method which describes the primary individual behavior. \n",
    "2. There must be a *model* class, which should inherit from `mesa.Model`. \n",
    "    - The `__init__()` method of this class is responsible for creating agents with their properties, as well as the space (often a grid) on which the simulation unfolds. \n",
    "    - This class must also have a `step()` method which provides a complete description of what happens in a single model time step. Often, this involves using a `Schedule` to call the `step()` method of each of the agents in some specified sequence. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's write a very simple model that demonstrates some of these requirements. Our model won't really do very much yet, but it will demonstrate the key techniques of defining the agent and model, adding agents to the model, and calling the `step()` methods. "

The `torus` argument of the grid determines whether the edges \"wrap around.\" If it is selected, then walking off the left side of the grid will put you back on the right side. This is often visualized as allowing the grid to lie on the surface of a torus, or donut: \n",
