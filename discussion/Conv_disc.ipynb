You undo the change and try a different change, B, that also makes your model worse.  It's very possible that if you do A and B *together* you'll get a better than what you had!  It's weird that way.\n",
        "- That being said, if you make a change and you do *better*, you should think about keeping it!  You might undo it a bit as you change more, but it's good to have the best model you've made so far as your current baseline.\n",

        "And here are a list of things you might want to change:\n",
        "- How long the model trains (the number of epochs)\n",
        "- How many layers are in the model\n",
        "- The types of each layer (dense, convolutional, pooling, etc.)\n",
        "- How big each hidden layer is (in terms of number of nodes or the number of output filters)\n",
        "- The activation functions.  A list is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations).  All you need to do is write the name in quotes (e.g. activation = 'elu').  Don't worry if you don't understand the difference between them, it's not too important right now.\n",
        "- The optimizer we use.  A list is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers).  Some of them might give you an error.  If so, just try a different one.  Again, it's okay if you don't understand how the different optimizers work.  You don't need to!  Again, you can just type the name in quotes (e.g., optimizer='sgd').\n",
        "- Consider doing a little more pre-processing on the data.  There are tips on how to pre-process data in the [worksheet](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.math.ucla.edu/~egeo/classes/spr21_pic16b-1/week5/ml_basics.ipynb) mentioned at the beginning.\n",

        "\n",
        "Lastly, as a goal to aim towards: 96% accuracy or more is possible with just the changes above.  If you get there, see if you can do better!  There are some more complicated changes you can do (such as adding even more types of layers!) that can yield better accuracy, although you do not need to attempt those yourself."
